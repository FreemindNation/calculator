This is a calculator project as part of the Odin Project curriculum. I will use javaScript, HTML and CSS  to complete the project. more details will be added as i go along.

The project is complete. It has three main files. a javaScript file function, a HTML file for design and a CSS file for styling.

The calculator is simple but has the capacity to perform all numerical operations with two or multiple operands at the same time.

The calculator also allows the use of floating point numbers as well as negative numbers.

for more information please refer to he code in the files.
